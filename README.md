This repo is a running list of some of the better visualizations I've made over time. 

For Sex#2, Race#2, Off#1, and Age#1, I uploaded a png of the race codes and a pdf of the offense codes. These all were made in R for my statistics capstone project which deals with Missouri crime data in 2022 (by way of NIBRS)

I explained the other plots further in the extended description upon upload.
